Ideal Project: Open-Source AI-Powered Document Search & Q&A System
This project will showcase expertise in LLMs, Generative AI, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), vector databases, and cloud AI solutions using only open-source tools.

📌 Project Overview
A self-hosted AI-powered document search & Q&A system that allows users to upload PDFs, DOCs, or text files, and query them using natural language. The system will use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch relevant context and generate accurate answers using an open-source LLM.

🛠️ Tech Stack (All Open-Source)
✅ LLM: Falcon, LLaMA 2, Mistral, or GPT-neoX (via Hugging Face)
✅ Vector Database: FAISS or ChromaDB
✅ Frameworks: LangChain, LlamaIndex
✅ AI Model Deployment: FastAPI for serving the model
✅ Cloud Options: Can be containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS, Azure, or GCP Free Tier
✅ Frontend: Streamlit for a user-friendly interface

🚀 Features
🔹 Upload & Index Documents: PDF, DOCX, or text files get parsed and indexed in a vector database.
🔹 RAG-based Q&A: Uses LlamaIndex to fetch relevant chunks before answering.
🔹 Real-time Querying: Ask questions and receive AI-generated answers based on the document’s content.
🔹 Scalable & Extendable: Can integrate new models or expand to multi-document search.


📐 Architectural Overview for AI-Powered Document Search & Q&A System
This open-source RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system will be built using modular components to ensure scalability, efficiency, and real-world usability.

🏗️ System Architecture
1️⃣ User Interaction Layer (Frontend)
    • Tech Stack: Streamlit (Python) or React.js 
    • Function: 
        ◦ Allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT). 
        ◦ Provides an input box for natural language queries. 
        ◦ Displays AI-generated answers with reference context. 

2️⃣ API & Backend Layer
    • Tech Stack: FastAPI (Python) 
    • Function: 
        ◦ Handles document processing and text extraction. 
        ◦ Manages query requests and interacts with the AI model. 
        ◦ Ensures efficient retrieval from the vector database. 
        ◦ Implements caching for fast responses. 

3️⃣ Document Processing & Indexing Layer
    • Tech Stack: PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, or Apache Tika (for document parsing) 
    • Function: 
        ◦ Converts PDF/DOCX into plain text. 
        ◦ Splits text into meaningful chunks for vectorization. 
        ◦ Stores processed data in a vector database. 

4️⃣ Embedding & Vector Storage Layer
    • Tech Stack: FAISS / ChromaDB 
    • Function: 
        ◦ Converts text chunks into vector embeddings (via OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 or BGE-M3 from Hugging Face). 
        ◦ Stores vectors for fast nearest-neighbor searches. 
        ◦ Enables efficient retrieval of relevant document sections. 

5️⃣ AI Model & Query Processing Layer
    • Tech Stack: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, LlamaIndex 
    • Function: 
        ◦ Accepts user queries, retrieves the most relevant document chunks. 
        ◦ Uses LLM (Mistral, LLaMA 2, Falcon, GPT-J, etc.) to generate a context-aware response. 
        ◦ Implements prompt engineering for improved responses. 

6️⃣ Deployment & Scaling
    • Containerization: Docker (for portability) 
    • Orchestration: Kubernetes (for horizontal scaling) 
    • CI/CD: GitHub Actions (automate deployments) 
    • Cloud Deployment: AWS/GCP/Azure Free Tier (optional) 

📊 Data Flow
1️⃣ User uploads document → Backend extracts text & chunks it
2️⃣ Text chunks converted to embeddings → Stored in FAISS/ChromaDB
3️⃣ User enters a query → Backend retrieves relevant chunks
4️⃣ Relevant context passed to LLM → Generates a response
5️⃣ AI-generated response displayed to user
