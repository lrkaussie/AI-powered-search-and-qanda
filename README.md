   - Real-time response display with source attribution
   - Asynchronous document processing feedback

2. **API & Backend Layer**
   - FastAPI-based RESTful API endpoints
   - Async request handling for improved performance
   - Request validation and error handling
   - Response caching for frequently asked questions

3. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   - Text extraction from multiple file formats
   - Content chunking with configurable overlap
   - Metadata extraction and preservation
   - Document structure preservation

4. **Vector Storage & Retrieval**
   - Efficient document embedding using Sentence Transformers
   - Vector similarity search with FAISS/ChromaDB
   - Configurable similarity thresholds
   - Metadata-enhanced retrieval

5. **RAG Implementation**
   - Context window optimization
   - Dynamic prompt engineering
   - Source document citation
   - Response quality scoring

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-document-search.git
cd ai-document-search
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

2. In a new terminal, start the Streamlit frontend:
```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìö Usage

1. **Upload Documents**:
   - Click the "Upload" button in the interface
   - Select your PDF, DOCX, or TXT files
   - Wait for processing to complete

2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Type your question in natural language
   - The system will retrieve relevant information and generate an answer
   - View source context alongside the answers

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Medical Research**: Quick analysis of clinical studies and medical papers
- **Legal Document Analysis**: Extract key information from contracts and legal documents
- **Financial Analysis**: Parse and query financial reports and statements
- **Academic Research**: Efficient literature review and textbook querying
- **Policy Research**: Analysis of government documents and policies
